For the data structure choice, consider the access patterns, expected cardinality, and cache locality requirements of your specific workload. Additionally, consider the operational complexity: deployment strategies, monitoring dashboards, alerting thresholds, runbook documentation, and incident response procedures. The testing strategy should include unit tests with deterministic scheduling, integration tests with fault injection, chaos engineering experiments, and load tests that simulate realistic production traffic patterns with varying request distributions.`,
